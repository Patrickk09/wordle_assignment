# WORDLE ASSESMENT
 Assesment of WORDLE clone written in React, Tailwind.


# steps taken to create

- `npm create vite wordle --template react-ts .`
-  [add tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite)
    -  npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
    -  npx tailwindcss init -p



- I started by getting one core algorithm working
-  done UI first, switched to making the basic word guess building block
- start making WordRow
- after that I updated props of WordRow and clean up styles somewhat
- spend way too long my whole day to get empty state of the game to have correct default height
- Refactor store to save computed guesses into store so I can calculate game state more easily
- this took far too much time than it should have.
- some minor refactoring to get isValidWord working.
- added the keyboard.
